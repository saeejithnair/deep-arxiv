# Project Summary: Deep-Arxiv

## Project Overview

A modern, minimalistic web application for exploring and analyzing academic papers. The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The application is deployed as a Cloudflare Worker.

## What We've Done So Far

1.  **Project Setup**: Cloned a project and restructured it by moving all frontend code into a `frontend` directory.
2.  **Configuration**: Updated all relevant configuration files (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `biome.json`, `netlify.toml`) to work with the new directory structure.
3.  **Local Development**: Successfully built the project using `bun run build` and ran it locally using `bun run dev`.
4.  **Cloudflare Setup**: Configured the project for Cloudflare Workers deployment by creating a `wrangler.toml` file and a `worker/src/worker.ts` file.
5.  **Deployment Fixes**: Resolved several deployment issues:
    *   Corrected the `assets` configuration in `wrangler.toml` from `bucket` to `directory`.
    *   Removed a `_redirects` file (leftover from a previous Netlify setup) that was causing an infinite loop.
    *   Removed the `limits` configuration from `wrangler.toml` as it's not available on the free plan.
6.  **Initial Deployment**: Successfully deployed the application to the Cloudflare workers.dev URL: `https://deep-arxiv.saeejithn.workers.dev/`.
7.  **Custom Domain**: Added a custom domain route to `wrangler.toml` to point `deep-arxiv.ai` to the Cloudflare worker. The custom domain is configured but not live yet.
8.  **Worker Asset Handling Fix**: Fixed KV namespace error in local development by updating `worker.ts` to use modern Cloudflare Workers asset handling:
    *   Removed deprecated `getAssetFromKV` import and usage
    *   Replaced with `env.ASSETS.fetch(request)` which works directly with the `assets` configuration
    *   This resolved the "no KV namespace bound to the script" error when running `wrangler dev`
